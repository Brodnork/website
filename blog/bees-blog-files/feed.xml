<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As most people reading this probably know, on October 1st, Cohost is shutting down. This website meant a lot to me, as it did for a lot of people. I need to write about it and get my thoughts out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won’t lie, I spent a good portion of last night sitting in bed crying. Being an artist on the internet is hard, and it keeps getting harder every month. Doubly so if you’re like me and made the bad choice of trying to make a living off of it. Cohost felt like a bit of a reprieve from that. It was an incredibly special community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I <a href="https://bumblebee.city/blog/the-heros-journey-or-how-going-to-a-furry-convention-fixed-my-brain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote before</a>, I’ve been struggling with trying to be less scared of what other people think of me. I’ve been trying to allow myself to be more messy, more visibly queer, more open to being whatever I am. Cohost played a big role in that. It helped me realize I HATED the way I was presenting myself online. Being clean and professional and perfect is so boring. I don’t want to limit my online presence to just being an indie game developer. It’s a big part of who I am, but not the only part. I don’t want to be just one thing. Cohost was a space where I could talk about random things like furry conventions or my favourite games or post a bunch of weird pictures of chevrotains. I didn’t feel the need to uphold some reputation. I could just hang out in a way I didn’t feel comfortable doing on sites like Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement that came from the site is incredible too. I had a modest amount of engagement on Cohost despite not having much interesting to post - the most interesting thing I’ve been working on over the past year is a game that’s too early to announce. I was so excited to finally have something cool and fun to share by the end of the year, and I’m gutted by the fact that there’s not enough time left in the site for me to share this game with the wonderful community Cohost has. I loved the site, but never got the chance to use it to the fullest. But even still, people seemed SIGNIFICANTLY more interested in anything I had to post there than anywhere else. I posted about me going to the Vancouver Game Garden last month all over Twitter, and one person from my modest following on Twitter showed up to play my demo. 3 people who weren’t even following me on Cohost showed up, and then two more showed up because they saw a post made by one of those first 3 recommending people stop by to play my demo specifically. People <em>love </em>things on Cohost in a way no other social media today has. It fills me with dread knowing I’m going to be going back to sites where most people following me really don’t care all that much about my work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I have hope a website like Cohost will appear again. Maybe it’s foolish to think that, and maybe people will feel too burned from the death of Cohost to want to use it. But I’ve never seen such an emotional, earnest, and deeply mournful response to the loss of a website before in my life. Cohost was needed by so many people. I believe the Cohost staff aren’t the only ones capable of making such a site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cohost showed the path to a better internet. Comment more. Curate your social media feeds more deeply. Step away from websites whenever you want. Engage with your communities. My relationship with social media has improved vastly. I’m not going to have as much fun on Twitter or Bluesky as I did on Cohost, and I think that just means I’m going to use them less. If I see something on Twitter that pisses me off, I’ll simply close the website for the day. I’ve seen many people post that Cohost has led them to do the same. The impact Cohost had on those who loved it is deep and positive and will last for a very long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better internet is possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for the amazing times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodnight, eggbug. One day we will meet again.</span></p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure how long I’ve been this way, but recently I’ve realized I’m someone who is way too scared of what other people think of me, including strangers. This is not an ideal trait to have when you’re someone who’s visibly queer, nor is it an ideal trait to have when you’re someone who puts very personal art out onto the internet for a living! This year, I’ve been trying to focus on getting better at not worrying about this and just exist. Easier said than done, of course.</p>
<p>Back in January, thanks to encouragement from my friend Strade (if you’re reading this hii), I made a fursona! I got a lot more invested in it than I expected I would, and spent several hours designing them. I even almost forgot eat that night because I was so focused. If you haven’t seen them yet, here they are!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://bumblebee.city/fennel.png" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p>Their name is Fennel and they’re a dog/sheep combo. It was a really fun form of self expression! Of course, having a fursona didn’t make me a furry or anything. It was just for fun. Of course.</p>
<p>And then two days later I registered for Vancoufur, a local furry convention.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, I grew more and more excited. I’ve been really struggling to make friends and meet people ever since I moved here a year ago, and I was hoping this would be a good chance to socialize with other terminally online queer weirdos.</p>
<p>Once I got there, it took a while for it to really click for me. I’m not exactly new to cons - I’ve been to the Calgary Fan Expo twice, the Vancouver Fan Expo once, and PAX West twice. Vancoufur was nothing like these. There weren’t a lot of booths, and there weren’t really that many panels going on at a time either. What was I supposed to do between events? Just sit around doing nothing? Don’t get me wrong, I was already having a lot of fun, but I wasn’t really sure why the con lasted for so long if there were so few booths and so few events.</p>
<p>On the second evening, I was bored and it was several hours until my next panel, so I wandered around and ended up in a big dance/rave area. Dances aren’t really my thing, but I figured it’d be something different to at least look at. Swaying back and forth awkwardly at the back of the room like I did at every dance in high school, I watched all these people dancing and having fun. People wearing fursuits, or cosplays, or maid dresses, or even just regular casual clothes, just dancing and enjoying being themselves. That’s when it hit me, what separated this from any other con I had been to. Standard cons are a bunch of booths and panels surrounding a shared interest. Furry cons are high energy, wholehearted celebrations of being a complete fucking weirdo, and I am so fucking on board with that.</p>
<p>After that point, I enjoyed the convention a lot more. I allowed myself to go all in and be weird and earnest and cringe! I talked to a lot of people! I joined the annoying chorus of YIPPIEs that would sprout up in the crowd every other hour! I tried on this big waggy tail thing at the Dealer’s Den! It was a lot of fun! Turns out being yourself and allowing yourself to have fun is… well, fun. Who knew! I never realized how much I needed something like this.</p>
<p>By the time the convention was over, I was exhausted and ready to sleep for a hundred years, but I knew I was fundamentally changed. I’m not the same person I was a week ago. I can already feel in my brain that the little evil leech that’s constantly screeching about how other people think I’m weird has started shrivelling up. It has no more food now that my response to “<i>other people think you’re fucking weird</i>” is usually an indifferent shrug. My anxiety hasn’t disappeared over night, of course, but it’s made an almost supernatural amount of progress over the course of a single weekend.</p>
<p>Over the past week, I’ve cared a lot less about whether strangers care about my pastel pink dyed hair or the fact that I’m wearing a skirt but have a clearly visible beard shadow. I’ve found myself ever so slightly dancing along a little bit to the music playing on the grocery store radio. I’ve felt a lot more free, and I’m having more little moments of fun in day to day life. It’s been less than a week since the con ended, and I hope this energy continues throughout the year and into the future.</p>
<p>I have already registered for next year’s con and will probably be going to another, smaller one in November. Yippie!</p>
