Welcome to the Science Bird edutainment program instruction guide!

----------

To set up the program, follow these simple instructions:

Step 1: Double click the file "SciBirdInstall.exe" .
Step 2: Follow the instructions in the Setup Wizard, and read the terms of use. 
Step 3: Install the program.
Step 4: To open the program immediately after installation, click "Launch Science Bird" on the end screen. Leave the box unchecked if you do not wish to open it right away.
Step 5: If the program is not opened, double click the file "ScienceBird.exe".
Step 6: Repeat this process on every student's personal computer, if there are more than one.
Step 7: Get the user of the personal computer to enter his or her information into the First Time Startup screen as requested. This can be changed later if you ask Science Bird very nicely. 
Step 8: Enjoy! You can now talk to Science Bird! To shut down the Science Bird before turning off your personal computer, tell him to go to sleep. You will need to reopen the program when you wish to talk to him again.

FAQ:

Q: What do I do if the Science Bird does not install/does not open?
A: Contact an H.E.L.P. administrator. 

Q: Can I change the color of the Science Bird?
A: No.

Q: What do I do if the Science Bird does not respond to me?
A: Check your microphone or keyboard settings. If you know everything is working properly, you may have previously said something that upset the Science Bird. Apologize to it immediately. 

Q: The Science Bird is saying facts that I know are not true, what do I do about it?
A: Science Bird was programmed to only say facts that are true. Every month, Science Bird connects to the Internet to connect to the H.E.L.P. Elysium Encyclopaedia supercomputer to update it's personal database to ensure it's information is up to date. You can force a database update by saying "that's not true!" This update may take several minutes. If your Science Bird is telling you facts that you know are not true, and this behavior persists after a database update, close the program and do not open it again.
