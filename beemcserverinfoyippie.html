	<p>Hi! My minecraft server has a few mods. You can download a zip file with all the mods bundled here:</p>
    <p><a href="mods.zip">Download mod pack</a></p>
    <p>The mods included are Ribbits (fucking adorable frog villagers), the glunch (slightly altered to have much less destructive potential), a minimap mod, and customizable player models which you can use to change how your little minecraft guy looks. It's totally optional to customize your model so you don't have to if you don't want to, but if you do want to there's a bunch of tutorials on youtube on how to use it.</p>
    <p>You'll need Minecraft version <b>1.20.1</b> with Forge installed. If you don't have Forge installed <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html">you can find the 1.20.1 version here.</a></p>
